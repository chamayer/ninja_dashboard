# Root and cross-service deferred work

This is the proposed successor to the root-level open-work portion of
`TODO.md`. Operations-only items belong in `operations/.work/backlog.md`.

## Dashboard reporting performance

- Reason deferred: broad historical and compliance cards previously exceeded
  acceptable response times.
- Relevant areas: reporting materialized views, Metabase bootstrap SQL, and
  activity/patch aggregations.
- Trigger: a removed or deferred card is prioritized for restoration.
- First verification: time candidate SQL against representative live data
  before changing dashboard definitions.

## Ingest domain separation

- Reason deferred: scheduling and startup orchestration remain shared even
  though domain packages exist.
- Relevant paths: `ingest/main.py`, domain entrypoints, shared scheduler and
  bootstrap plumbing.
- Constraint: do not break current schedules, manual-run endpoints, migrations,
  or shared-client reuse.
- Trigger: an approved runtime isolation or independent deployment requirement.

## Legacy agent-compliance cutover

- Reason deferred: native Operations paths are substantially implemented, but
  legacy consumers and destructive retirement require audit.
- Relevant areas: `ingest/agent_compliance/`, scheduler/manual endpoints,
  legacy schema, Metabase consumers, configuration, and migration history.
- Constraints: backup, consumer audit, verified parity, and explicit
  destructive approval.
- Trigger: P7 cutover approval.

## Root backlog rules

- Do not duplicate Operations-only items here.
- Do not retain completed milestone checklists.
- Move an item into `.work/plan.md` only when approved as active cross-service
  work.
